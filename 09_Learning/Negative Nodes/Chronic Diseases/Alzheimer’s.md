# Alzheimer’s Disease — Final Disease Node

## 🧨 Description
A progressive neurodegenerative disease marked by cognitive decline, memory loss, and neuronal death. Strongly associated with metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and vascular instability.

## 🔁 Upstream Dysfunctions
- [[Insulin Resistance]]
- [[Chronic Inflammation]]
- [[Sleep Fragmentation]]
- [[Oxidative Stress]]
- [[Depressive Symptoms]]

## 🔁 Contributing Root Causes
- [[Poor Diet]]
- [[Social Isolation]]
- [[Chronic Psychological Stress]]
- [[Circadian Disruption]]

## 🔬 Diagnostic Criteria
- Confirmed via PET scan (amyloid/tau)
- MoCA score <26
- Cognitive decline ≥6 months

## 🩺 Symptoms / Clinical Findings
- Memory loss
- Disorientation
- Word-finding difficulty
- Personality changes

## 📉 Model Implications
- Long latency — early lifestyle signal detection is key
- Use as final node in neurocognitive modeling graph
