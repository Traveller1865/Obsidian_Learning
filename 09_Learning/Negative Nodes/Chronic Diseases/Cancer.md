# Cancer — Final Disease Node

## 🧨 Description
Uncontrolled cell growth due to accumulated DNA mutations and immune dysregulation. Rooted in inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunction, and environmental exposures.

## 🔁 Upstream Dysfunctions
- [[Oxidative Stress]]
- [[Systemic Inflammation]]
- [[Immune Dysfunction]]
- [[Endocrine Disruption]]

## 🔁 Contributing Root Causes
- [[Environmental Toxins]]
- [[Poor Diet]]
- [[Chronic Stress]]
- [[Smoking / Alcohol Use]]

## 🔬 Diagnostic Criteria
- Biopsy confirmation
- Imaging (CT/MRI/PET)
- Tumor markers (e.g., CA-125, PSA, CEA)

## 🩺 Symptoms / Clinical Findings
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue
- Pain or masses
- Organ-specific symptoms

## 📉 Model Implications
- Use probabilistic risk modeling (site-specific)
- Focus on early detection signals in inflammation + redox + methylation pathways

## 🛠 Disease Management Levers
| Lever                     | Effect                         | Evidence Level |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| [[Anti-Inflammatory Diet]] | Lowers initiation triggers      | Moderate       |
| [[Chemotherapy / Immunotherapy]] | Disease-specific            | High           |

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Multifactorial node — use for integrative screening flag generation across symptom + exposure + biology patterns
