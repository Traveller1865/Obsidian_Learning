# Environmental Toxins — Root Cause Node

## 🔍 Description
Exposure to heavy metals, pesticides, plastics, and air pollution increases oxidative stress, disrupts endocrine function, and weakens immunity.

## 🧬 Biological Impact Pathways
- [[Oxidative Stress]]
- [[Systemic Inflammation]]
- [[Immune Dysfunction]]

## ⚠️ Contributes To
- [[Autoimmune Disease]]
- [[Cancer]]
- [[Cognitive Decline]]

## 🧩 Associated Biomarkers
- Heavy metals (blood/urine)
- Glutathione
- CRP
- Eosinophils

## 🛠 Interventions
| Intervention         | Evidence Level | Expected Risk Reduction |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Air Filtration       | Moderate       | 30–50%                   |
| Detox Protocols      | Low            | 15–30%                   |
| Filtered Water       | Moderate       | 25–45%                   |

## 🧠 Model Notes
Node activates if toxin load scores above baseline in screening
