## 🔍 Description
Persistent psychological stress activates the HPA axis, elevating cortisol and leading to metabolic dysfunction, immune suppression, and poor sleep.

## 🧬 Biological Impact Pathways
- [[High Cortisol]]
- [[Systemic Inflammation]]
- [[Poor Sleep Quality]]

## ⚠️ Contributes To
- [[Hypertension]]
- [[Visceral Obesity]]
- [[Autoimmune Disease]]

## 🧩 Associated Biomarkers
- Salivary cortisol
- HRV
- Sleep latency
- Inflammatory cytokines

## 🛠 Interventions
| Intervention         | Evidence Level | Expected Risk Reduction |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Mindfulness Meditation | High         | 35–55%                   |
| Therapy/CBT           | Moderate       | 40–50%                   |
| Adaptogens            | Low            | 15–25%                   |

## 🧠 Model Notes
Node activates when subjective stress rating >7/10 for 10+ days
