# Leptin Resistance — Biological Response Node

## 🔁 Triggered By
- [[Poor Diet]]
- [[Visceral Obesity]]
- [[Circadian Disruption]]

## ⛓ Leads To
- [[Obesity]]
- [[Insulin Resistance]]
- [[Sleep Fragmentation]]

## 📊 Biomarkers
- Fasting leptin >20 ng/mL (men), >30 ng/mL (women)
- Persistent hunger despite high caloric intake

## 🔍 Threshold
Elevated leptin and appetite dysregulation >7 days

## 🛠 Modifiable By
| Intervention                | Effect                 |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Time-restricted eating      | Improves leptin rhythm |
| Resistance training         | Improves sensitivity   |
