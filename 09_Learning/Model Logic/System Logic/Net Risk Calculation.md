# ðŸ”¢ Net Risk Calculation

## Formula

For each node:

net_score = âˆ‘(upstream_risk_i Ã— Î²_i) - âˆ‘(upstream_resilience_j Ã— Î²_j)

Where:
- `Î²_i` = positive coefficient from an upstream dysfunction node
- `Î²_j` = negative coefficient from a protective node

## Example

For node: `Insulin Resistance`
- 0.8 from Poor Diet
- 0.7 from Physical Inactivity
- 0.6 from Daily Exercise
- 0.5 from Fasting State

net_score = 1.5 - 1.1 = 0.4 â†’ Node becomes active if threshold = 0.3
## Use

This logic allows dynamic health scoring, rebalancing risk each day based on both damage and repair inputs.
