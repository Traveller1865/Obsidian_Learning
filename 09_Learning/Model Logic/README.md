# 🧠 Mynd & Bodi Institute – Ontology Engine

This Obsidian vault contains the structured ontology and simulation logic for tracking the progression of chronic disease via modifiable lifestyle and biological pathways.

## 📁 Directory Overview

- `Model Logic/` – Node logic files grouped by category (Root Causes, Biological Responses, etc.)
- `Protective Pathways Logic/` – Positive/resilience nodes that counteract disease propagation
- `System Logic/` – Global simulation rules and engine documentation
- `Graph Definitions/` – Technical mappings and causal relationships
- `Data Inputs/` – Sample input data and mapping specs for wearable and lab integration

## ✅ Key Use Cases

- Visualize chronic disease causality
- Score dynamic risk states from wearables/labs
- Simulate intervention effects
- Train AI/ML models to predict outcomes and suggest next steps
