# 🧠 Node Logic — Hormonal Axis Disruption

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Irregular cortisol, TSH, testosterone, estrogen, LH/FSH
- Sleep + cycle irregularities
- Libido decline, mood instability, or thermoregulation issues

## 🔁 Risk Propagation
- [[PCOS]] (β = 0.8)
- [[Fatigue]] (β = 0.65)
- [[Infertility]] (β = 0.7)
- [[Depressive Symptoms]] (β = 0.6)

- **Decay Half-Life**: 30–60 days
- **Scaling**: Compounded by stress, sleep, toxins

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if 2+ hormonal markers out of range + symptoms
- Recommend sleep timing correction, endocrine detox, dietary fat balance

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Reassess hormones + symptoms in 4–8 weeks
- Deactivate with lab normalization and clinical improvement

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Reflects dysregulation of multiple systems (HPATG axis) — pivotal for reproductive and mood resilience
