# 🧠 Node Logic — Digestive Dysregulation

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Bloating, discomfort, irregular stool (log-based)
- Stool transit <3x/week or >3x/day
- Food reactivity or post-meal fatigue

## 🔁 Risk Propagation
- [[Leaky Gut]] (β = 0.75)
- [[Immune Dysfunction]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Fatigue]] (β = 0.5)
- [[Autoimmune Disease]] (β = 0.55)

- **Decay Half-Life**: 21–30 days
- **Scaling**: Worsens with stress, alcohol, processed food, antibiotics

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if symptom cluster persists >10 days
- Recommend FODMAP trial, GI rest protocol, gut flora support

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Recheck symptom log + stool pattern in 2–3 weeks
- Deactivate when digestion normalizes for 7+ days

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Central node for long-range risk — subtle, chronic, and often downstream of food quality + stress
