# 🧠 Node Logic — Sleep Fragmentation

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Sleep stages show >3 arousals/hour (wearable or PSG)
- Sleep efficiency <80% + WASO >30 min
- Subjective rating of waking >2× per night

## 🔁 Risk Propagation
- [[Fatigue]] (β = 0.7)
- [[Depressive Symptoms]] (β = 0.65)
- [[Hormonal Axis Disruption]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Insulin Resistance]] (β = 0.55)

- **Decay Half-Life**: 7–14 days
- **Scaling**: Exponential under stress, stimulant use, apnea

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if fragmentation score ↑ for 5+ days
- Recommend breathing retraining, light timing, magnesium or GABA support

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Deactivate if arousals drop and deep sleep >20% for 5 nights

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Subtle but potent — fragmented sleep impairs metabolic, immune, and mood recovery even if total duration is “normal”
