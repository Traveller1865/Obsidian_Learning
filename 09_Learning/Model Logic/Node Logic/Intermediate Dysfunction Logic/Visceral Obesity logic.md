# 🧠 Node Logic — Visceral Obesity

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Waist circumference >40” (men) or >35” (women)
- Waist:height ratio >0.5
- Android fat pattern via DEXA or BIA

## 🔁 Risk Propagation
- [[Insulin Resistance]] (β = 0.85)
- [[Inflammation]] (β = 0.7)
- [[Cardiovascular Disease]] (β = 0.75)
- [[Fatty Liver]] (β = 0.6)

- **Decay Half-Life**: 45–90 days
- **Scaling**: Linear with sugar + stress + inactivity load

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if waist expands + weight gain >5% in 30 days
- Recommend fasting, resistance training, circadian lock-in

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Deactivate after 4 weeks of consistent circumference drop + metabolic markers

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Visceral fat is metabolically active — drives most cardiometabolic risks independent of total weight
