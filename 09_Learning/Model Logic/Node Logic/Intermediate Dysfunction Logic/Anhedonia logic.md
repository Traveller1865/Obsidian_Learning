# 🧠 Node Logic — Anhedonia

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Self-reported pleasure score <4/10 for 5+ days
- Lack of response to normally enjoyable activities
- Flattened affect or blunted reward system (survey/log)

## 🔁 Risk Propagation
- [[Depressive Symptoms]] (β = 0.75)
- [[Social Isolation]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Fatigue]] (β = 0.5)
- [[Cognitive Decline]] (β = 0.4)

- **Decay Half-Life**: 14–21 days
- **Scaling**: Exponential when combined with poor sleep, inflammation

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if mood score <5 + reduced positive affect log
- Recommend structured social engagement, dopamine rebalance protocol, sunshine walk

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Reassess pleasure score after 7 days of activity protocol
- Deactivate if response to pleasurable stimuli resumes

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Early mood signal — often present before full depressive syndrome; modifiable via novelty, sunlight, and reward-seeking behaviors
