# 🧠 Node Logic — Depressive Symptoms

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Mood score <5/10 for ≥7 days
- Sleep + appetite disruption
- Negative cognitive loop, low motivation

## 🔁 Risk Propagation
- [[Chronic Psychological Stress]] (β = 0.7)
- [[Sleep Fragmentation]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Social Isolation]] (β = 0.65)
- [[Hormonal Imbalance]] (β = 0.5)

- **Decay Half-Life**: 30 days
- **Scaling**: Feedback loop with anhedonia, sleep, inflammation

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if PHQ-2 or subjective log shows downward mood for 1+ week
- Recommend sunlight challenge, structured rhythm, social engagement, dietary reset

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Reassess mood and behavior input after 7–10 days
- Deactivate if sustained mood >6 and behavior improves

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Depression is not just psychological — inflammation, HRV, hormones, and circadian rhythm all affect symptom severity
