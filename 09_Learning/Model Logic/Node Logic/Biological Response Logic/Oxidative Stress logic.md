# 🧠 Node Logic — Oxidative Stress

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Elevated 8-OHdG, MDA, F2-isoprostanes (urine, blood)
- Antioxidant status low (glutathione, CoQ10, SOD)
- Persistent fatigue, skin aging, low recovery trend

## 🔁 Risk Propagation
- [[Mitochondrial Dysfunction]] (β = 0.7)
- [[Immune Dysfunction]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Cancer]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Cardiovascular Disease]] (β = 0.55)

- **Decay Half-Life**: 30–60 days
- **Scaling**: Exponential with pollution, toxins, alcohol, and overtraining

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if 2+ redox markers abnormal + symptoms cluster
- Recommend antioxidant protocol, liver detox pathways, inflammation control

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Recheck labs or symptom cluster after 21–30 days of intervention

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Silent precursor to broad cellular decline — often missed in early phases, worsens most downstream systems
