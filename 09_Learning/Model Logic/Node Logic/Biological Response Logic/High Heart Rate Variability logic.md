# 🧠 Node Logic — High HRV

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- HRV >70 ms (men), >80 ms (women), or personal baseline +20%
- Low LF/HF ratio (<1.0) + good parasympathetic recovery
- HRV bounce after exercise, fasting, or breathwork session

## 🔁 Protective Effects
- ↓ [[Chronic Psychological Stress]] likelihood
- ↓ [[Sleep Fragmentation]]
- ↓ [[Cardiovascular Disease]] risk
- ↑ [[Exercise Recovery]]
- ↑ [[Vagal Tone]]

- **Decay Half-Life**: 5–7 days (if disrupted by poor sleep, stress, alcohol)
- **Scaling**: Linear for risk buffering

## 🚨 Insight Rules
- Highlighted when HRV trend ↑ over 7 days
- Reinforce protective habit (fasting, recovery, sleep)

## 🛠 Reassessment Feedback
- If HRV trend drops >20%, investigate root causes (stress, illness)

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Acts as a global resilience buffer — the higher the HRV, the more blunted the propagation of stress, inflammation, and fatigue
