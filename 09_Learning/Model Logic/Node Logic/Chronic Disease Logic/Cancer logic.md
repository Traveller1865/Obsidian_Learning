# 🧠 Node Logic — Cancer

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Confirmed biopsy or imaging diagnosis
- Tumor markers elevated (e.g. PSA, CA-125, CEA)
- Fatigue, cachexia, bleeding, or mass symptoms

## 🔁 Upstream Contributors
- [[Oxidative Stress]] (β = 0.7)
- [[Insulin Resistance]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Toxin Exposure]] (β = 0.55)
- [[Chronic Inflammation]] (β = 0.6)

- **Progression Window**: Years to decades
- **Scaling**: Latent until accumulation threshold breached

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if unexplained weight loss + multiple upstream dysfunctions active
- Recommend early detection screen if risk score > threshold

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Track metabolic markers + detox capacity
- In remission, monitor inflammation + recurrence risks

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Cancer is a systemic breakdown endpoint — early-stage risk scoring must integrate metabolic and immune dysfunctions
