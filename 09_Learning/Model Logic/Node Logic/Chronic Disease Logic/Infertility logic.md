# 🧠 Node Logic — Infertility

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Failure to conceive after 12 months (age <35) or 6 months (age ≥35)
- Abnormal FSH, LH, AMH, estradiol, testosterone, TSH
- Irregular or absent ovulation, low libido, sperm abnormalities

## 🔁 Upstream Contributors
- [[Hormonal Axis Disruption]] (β = 0.8)
- [[PCOS]] (β = 0.75)
- [[Insulin Resistance]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Stress]] (β = 0.65)

- **Progression Window**: 6 months – years
- **Scaling**: Compounding with toxin load, nutrient deficits, cycle disruption

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if multiple hormonal markers + cycle/sexual symptoms present
- Recommend endocrine optimization, mitochondrial support, detox protocol

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Track ovulatory cycle, semen parameters, libido
- Deactivate when reproductive markers return to normal range

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Infertility is a barometer of systemic resilience — reproductive dysfunction is often a downstream alert for total-body imbalance
