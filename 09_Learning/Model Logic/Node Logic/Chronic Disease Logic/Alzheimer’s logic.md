# 🧠 Node Logic — Alzheimer’s

## 🔑 Activation Criteria
- Clinical diagnosis or MMSE <24 + imaging support
- History of mild cognitive impairment + hippocampal atrophy
- ApoE4 homozygous status (genetic risk)

## 🔁 Upstream Contributors
- [[Insulin Resistance]] (β = 0.7)
- [[Sleep Fragmentation]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Chronic Inflammation]] (β = 0.6)
- [[Autonomic Dysfunction]] (β = 0.5)

- **Progression Window**: 10–20 years
- **Scaling**: Nonlinear — sharp decline after threshold inflammation + neurodegeneration

## 🚨 Alert Rules
- Trigger if cognitive decline + metabolic dysregulation + sleep dysfunction cluster
- Recommend multimodal protocol: fasting, anti-inflammatory diet, cognitive training

## 🛠 Intervention Feedback
- Track MoCA/mental function scores quarterly
- Consider reversal or stabilization phase if risk reduced

## 🧠 Modeling Notes
Long arc disease — prevention focus is critical; strongly modifiable by lifestyle decades before onset
