**Type**: Protective  
**Tags**: #protective #movement #metabolic #cardiorespiratory  
**Trigger Examples**:
- Steps > 8000 (wearable)
- HR zone 2 duration > 30 min
- Resistance training session (manual log or device-detected)

**Downstream Influence**:
- ↓ Insulin Resistance
- ↓ Visceral Obesity
- ↓ Fatty Liver
- ↓ Depressive Symptoms
- ↓ Cardiovascular Disease Risk

**Description**:
Daily physical activity, particularly aerobic and resistance-based training, enhances insulin sensitivity, reduces visceral fat, and improves metabolic flexibility. It is a potent buffer against nearly every chronic disease pathway.
