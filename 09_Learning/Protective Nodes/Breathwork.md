**Type**: Protective  
**Tags**: #protective #autonomic #stress_modulation #HRV  
**Trigger Examples**:
- Box breathing ≥ 5 minutes/day
- Guided breath sessions (logged or detected)
- Rapid increase in HRV following session

**Downstream Influence**:
- ↓ Sympathetic Dominance
- ↓ High Cortisol
- ↑ High HRV
- ↓ Sleep Fragmentation

**Description**:
Slow, intentional breathing stimulates the vagus nerve and rebalances autonomic tone. Over time, it reduces cortisol, enhances sleep, and improves emotional resilience — key for recovery from chronic stress states.
