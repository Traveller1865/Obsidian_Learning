**Type**: Protective  
**Tags**: #protective #fasting #glucose_regulation #autophagy  
**Trigger Examples**:
- Eating window < 10 hours
- Overnight fasting > 13 hours (via app or wearable)
- Low insulin + glucose state detected in labs

**Downstream Influence**:
- ↓ Insulin Resistance
- ↓ Inflammation
- ↓ Fatty Liver
- ↓ Glucose Intolerance

**Description**:
Time-restricted eating and extended fasting reduce glycemic variability, lower insulin levels, and promote cellular recycling (autophagy). These metabolic effects reverse early-stage dysfunction and slow disease propagation.
